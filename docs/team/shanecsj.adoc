== PROJECT: Cooking Papa

---

== Overview

Cooking Papa is a desktop cookbook application used to manage recipes and ingredients for cooking. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented `inventory cook recipe` command
** What it does: Allows the user to remove all ingredients of a specified recipe from their inventory after cooking it.
** Justification: This feature improves the usability of the application significantly as users need to
remove the used ingredients from their inventory after preparing a recipe. The application should thus provide
a convenient command to assist the user in accomplishing this task.
** Highlights: This feature will be frequently used as it allows users to update their inventory after preparing a recipe.
** Credits: The implementation and testing of the `Ingredient` and `IngredientList` classes was a team effort which is vital to the successful
implementation of this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented commands under `cookbook` category
** Implemented the add, remove and view commands and their parsers
** Implemented skeleton classes for the search commands and their parsers
