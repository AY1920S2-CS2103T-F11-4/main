== Introduction

Cooking Papa is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes. More importantly, Cooking Papa is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Cooking Papa can help you plan and cook meals more easily than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
