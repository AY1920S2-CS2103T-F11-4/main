== Introduction

Cooking Papa is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes. More importantly,
Cooking Papa is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Cooking Papa can help you
plan and cook meals more easily than traditional GUI apps. Interested?
