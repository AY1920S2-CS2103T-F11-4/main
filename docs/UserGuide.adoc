== Introduction

Cooking Papa is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing recipes. More importantly, Cooking Papa is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Cooking Papa can help you plan and cook meals more easily than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
