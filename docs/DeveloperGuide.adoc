== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Controls the user interface of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes the commands of the App.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cookbook remove recipe 2`.

.Component interactions for `cookbook remove recipe 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CookingPapaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cookbook remove recipe 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cookbook remove recipe 2` Command
image::CookbookRemoveRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Cookbook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Cookbook`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Cookbook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Cookbook` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `Inventory` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `Cart` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add Recipe to the Cookbook
==== Implementation

The recipe addition mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookAddCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class. The
format of the command is as follows: `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT_NAME]... [q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]... [t/TAG]...`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a recipe adding command using the command line input `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION
[i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]... [s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`.
.  `CookbookAddCommandParser` parsers the user input and checks if `n/NAME` and `d/DESCRIPTION` are provided. It then
parses the input into the following fields: recipe name, recipe description, ingredients, steps, and tags.

+
Note that
the ingredient names and ingredient quantities provided must be the same, or a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (names.size() != quantities.size()) {
    throw new ParseException(
        String.format(MESSAGE_DIFFERENT_NUMBER_OF_INPUTS, names.size(), quantities.size()));
}
----
{blank}

. These fields are then passed as parameters for `Recipe`, which is then passed as the parameter for
`CookbookAddCommand` and returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CookbookAddCommand#execute()` which checks if the cookbook already contains the same recipe with the same name, description, ingredient names, ingredient quantities, and tags using `Model#hasCookbookRecipe()`.
+
If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown, stating that the user is attempting to add a duplicate recipe:
+
[source,java]
----
if (model.hasCookbookRecipe(toAdd)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_RECIPE);
}
----
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCookbookRecipe` will be executed, with the recipe to be added as a parameter.
. `Model#addCookbookRecipe()` then executes `Cookbook#addRecipe()`, which adds the recipe to the cookbook, and the
`FilteredList<Recipe>` representing the recipes in the cookbook are updated with `Model#updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList()`:
+
[source,java]
----
updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES)
----
where `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES = unused -> true`.
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user is then returned to `LogicManager`, which can passed back to
`MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

.UML object diagram of Recipe
image::RecipeObjectDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation reasoning

This command is implemented this way  to allow a user to add a recipe with optional fields (ingredients, steps, tags) -
only the recipe name and recipe description are mandatory fields. This way, a user does not have input all the fields
that they may not have at the moment to create a recipe. After creating the skeleton of the recipe, the user can then
use the other `Cookbook` commands to add ingredients and steps to the recipe. However, one key point is that should
ingredient names be provided, the same number of ingredient quantities have to be provided as well.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe adding function works (full command [`cookbook add recipe
                                                                                          n/Recipe name d/Recipe
                                                                                          description i/Ingredient 1
                                                                                          q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2
                                                                                          q/20 ml s/Do step 1 s/Do
                                                                                          step 2 t/This t/Is t/A

==== How the feature works
Step 1: Input the command in the command box, then hit kbd:[Enter] on the keyboard. The command is as follows:
`cookbook add recipe n/Recipe name d/Recipe description i/Ingredient 1 q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2 q/20 ml s/Do step 1
 s/Do step 2 t/This t/Is t/A t/Tag`.

Step 3: The newly added recipe will now appear in the recipes panel, which a brief overview, consisting of its name,
description, and tags. To view all the details of a recipe, the user can either enter `cookbook view recipe INDEX`,
where index is a valid integer, or click the view button.

|===
||Design A: Parse each category separately (current choice)  | Design B: Parse all the categories together
|Description
|Each category (ingredient name, ingredient quantity, step description, tag) are parsed separately and returned as `List`. If the returned `List` is empty, then it means that that field was not provided in the input, and will be set to an empty `List` in the recipe.
|Each category will be parsed together in one function in `CookbookAddCommandParser`
|Pros
a|
- Provides more flexibility for the user and does not make it mandatory to input fields that they may not necessarily
have.
- No need to deal with null values, can simply check if list is empty.
a|
- Straightforward
- No need to create and call multiple methods from other classes
|Cons
a|
- More methods have to be executed which may increase time and NPath complexity.
- Debugging and tracing becomes more confusing due to the method being defined in the lowest level of abstraction.
a|
- Have to deal with null values and include null checks (`ifPresent()` etc.)
- Method will be very long and decreases readability

=== Export ingredients in cart to PDF file
The user may use this command to export the ingredients in their cart to a PDF file, which they can then use as their
shopping list at the supermarkets.

==== Implementation
The cart exporting mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookExportCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class.
The format is as follows: `cart export`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a cart export command using the command line input `cart export`.
. `CartExportCommandParser` parses the user input and checks if the argument passed to it is an empty String, as the
command takes in no extra parameters.
+
Note that if the String is not empty, a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (userInput.isEmpty()) {
    return new CartExportCommand();
} else {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, CartExportCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
----
+
This means that `cart export ingredient` will not work.
. `CartExportCommandParser` then returns a `CartExportCommand` to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartExportCommand#execute()` calls the static method of `PdfExporter`,
`PdfExporter#exportCart()`, which takes in the `ObservableList<Ingredient>` stored in `Cart`
. Step 4 is executed within a try-catch block. If a previously generated pdf (saved as `cart.pdf` by default) is
opened in another program, or there is an issue writing to the PDF file (more information can be found
https://api.itextpdf.com/iText5/5.59/com/itextpdf/text/DocumentException.html[here]), a `CommandResult` with an error
message will returned to `LogicManager`:
+
[source,java]
----
try {
    PdfExporter.exportCart(model.getCart().getIngredientList());
} catch (IOException | DocumentException e) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FILE_NOT_FOUND);
}
----
. Else, a `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user will be returned to `LogicManager`. The
`CommandResult` is then passed back to `MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay
.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

==== Implementation reasoning
This command was implemented to bridge the (current, v1.4) inadequacy of Cooking Papa, which is that it is not
portable (yet). It was still not convenient _enough_ to be able to organize cart ingredients. Evenutally, users had
to go outside to the supermarket, and Cooking Papa is a desktop-only application. By allowing users to export the
ingredients in their cart to a PDF file, they can then print it out, or transfer it to their mobile devices, and
bring them along as shopping lists. Additionally, the layout and content of the generated PDF file is simple,
informational, and easy for users to extend, allowing them to add (handwritten or  annotated) remarks.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the function of exporting ingredients in the cart to a PDF file works:

|Cons
a|
- More formatting code required

|Pros
a|
- Easier to implement as there will be less information to parse
- Keeps the exported PDF short and sweet
- Ingredients in the inventory and recipes in the cookbook generally correlates (and are consequential of) with the
ingredients in the cart, so exporting the inventory as well as the cookbook is likely to be redundant.

|===

// tag::cookbooksearchinventory[]
=== Search for recipes based on ingredients in the inventory
==== Implementation
The comparison is facilitated by the `RecipeInventorySimilarityComparator`. It extends `Comparator<Recipe>` and stores
the inventory being used for ingredient comparison.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how objects interact when a user executes the command:

image::CookbookSearchByInventorySequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::cookbooksearchinventory[]

=== Adding ingredients to inventory and cart
The inventory and cart acts as storage for `Ingredient` classes. They are facilitated by `InventoryCommand` and `CartCommand`
respectively, which extends the `Command` abstract class. Since `CartAddCommand` and `InventoryAddCommand` both serve the
same purpose in different contexts of `Cart` and `Inventory` respectively, they will be mentioned together in tandem. +
The format of the commands are as follows:

* For cart: `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
* For inventory: `inventory add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

==== Implementation

Below is a step-by-step sequence of what happens when the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` is added.

. The user adds a ingredient to the cart by entering the command `cart  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` in the command line input.
. `CartAddCommandParser` parsers the input to check and verify that the input provided for `i/INGREDIENT_NAME` amd `q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
are correct. Otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown.
. The fields are then passed to `CartAddIngredientCommand` as an `Ingredient` object and is returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartAddIngredientCommand#execute()` and checks if the `Ingredient` object given has the same `INGREDIENT_NAME` and
`INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` unit. If that `Ingredient` exists, it will simply add on to the quantity of that ingredient. Otherwise,
a new instance of that `Ingredient` will be added to the Cart.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCartIngredient` will be executed, with the given `Ingredient` as the parameter
. `Model#addCartIngredient` then executes, adding the `Ingredient` to the local cart storage and updates with
`Model#updateFilteredCartIngredientList()`.
. A `CommandResult` with the successful text message is returned to `LogicManager` and will be displayed to the user via the GUI to feedback to the
user that the `Ingredient` has been successfully added.

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory` with the command `inventory  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

==== Implementation reasoning
This command was implemented to allow the user know to add an ingredient to the cart or inventory respectively.
An ingredient only has two main components - its name and quantity. We allow the user to use their own measurement up to their own
preferences and do not force any fixed unit of measurement. Although similar, `Cart` and `Ingredients` differ in certain functions
from a user's point of view. For a user to immediately sort where they wish to sort the ingredient they are adding, `Cart` and
`Inventory` is the first parameter they would use for the command.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the function of adding ingredients to cart work (full command omitted for brevity):

.Sequence diagram for CartAddIngredientCommand
image::CartAddIngredientSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== How the feature works

Step 1: The below diagram shows an initially empty cart

image::CartAddCommand1.png[]

Step 2: Input the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`. An example command is as follows: `cart add ingredient i/Eggs q/10`.

image::CartAddCommand2.png[]

Step 3: Hit kbd:[Enter]. The cart should be updated as follows:

image::CartAddCommand3.png[]

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory`

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: The need for many parsers for this command

.Design considerations for the need for many parsers for this command
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Create parsers for every individual action | Design B: Create parsers for each specific action

|Description
|The command will go through the parsers in the following order: `CookingPapaParser` -> `CartCommandParser` -> `CartAddCommandParser`
-> `CartAddIngredientParser` before finally returning `CartAddIngredientCommand`. We eventually went with this as we wanted the add
functionality to be expanded, namely to be able to add all the ingredients of cookbook recipes into the cart.
| `CartAddCommand` will not be created facilitate `CartAddIngredientCommand` and `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand`.


|Pros
|More organised and can do more with `cart add` as the prefix.
|Many parser classes to make and keep track of.

|Cons
|The classes can be more specific and atomic in their actions.
|Might lead to disorganisation during troubleshooting with so many classes to keep track.
|===

=== Moving ingredients from cart to inventory
The user may use this command after their shopping trip. With this one command, all ingredients will be shifted from the cart to the inventory.

==== Implementation
This command is facilitated by `CartMoveCommand`, which extends the `Command` class. The format of the command is as follows:
`cart move`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when the user executes this command.

. The user enters the command `cart move` in to the command line input.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then ensures that the user does not enter any other commands after `cart clear`.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then returns a `CartMoveCommand` and returns it to `LogicManager`
. `LogicManager` calls `CartMoveCommand#execute()`. If there are other commands after `cart clear`, a `CommandException`
will be thrown.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will be executed.
. `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will move every ingredient from the `cart` and add it into the `inventory`
. A `CommandResult` with the success message text will be returned to `LogicManager`, which will then be passed to `MainWindow`
and will then feedback to the user.

==== Implementation reasoning
This command is implemented to ease the process of having the user adding every single ingredient to their inventory after they have bought ingredients from their cart
and eventually deleting the cart after that tedious process. These gives a convenience to users that frequently use our application and we forsee
that such an action will be used very often by these users. As this command only performs an atomic action, no extra
arguments are needed to further supplement the use of this command.

==== Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how this function works (full command omitted for brevity):

.Sequence Diagram for CartMoveCommand
image::CartMoveSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== How this feature works
Step 1: This feature is intended when you have ingredients in the cart. As an example, the diagram below shows an
empty inventory, along with a cart with an ingredient.

image::CartMoveCommand1.png[]

Step 2: Press kbd:[Enter]. The ingredients from cart will all be shifted to inventory as shown in the diagram below

image::CartMoveCommand2.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Allowing users to move some or all ingredients from cart to inventory

.Design considerations for allowing users to move some or all ingredients from cart to inventory
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Move all ingredients | Design B: Allow users to move individually or exclude some ingredients when moving

|Description
|There was a consideration to allow the user to move the ingredients by individual ingredients. Eventually the options was
not given as we know that typical users will want to move all the ingredients except for individual ingredients.
| The use cases of such an action happening is very little and the user can simply manually remove the few
ingredients they do not wish to add to the inventory after using the `cart move` command. The user can also manually
add back the ingredients to the cart after it is cleared if they wish to.

|Pros
|Straightforward to implement
|Lesser implementations, more time to focus on other parts of the project

|Cons
|Lesser functionality to users that really want to only move certain ingredients
|Poorer user experience for users that do not want to move all ingredients from the cart to inventory on a regular basis,
|===

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism will be facilitated by `VersionedCookingPapa`.
It extends `CookingPapa` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `cookingPapaStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCookingPapa#commit()` -- Saves the current state of CookingPapa in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous state of CookingPapa from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone state of CookingPapa from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, `Model#undoCookingPapa()` and `Model#redoCookingPapa()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCookingPapa` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CookingPapa state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `cookbook remove recipe 2` command to delete the 2nd recipe in the cookbook of CookingPapa.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `cookbook remove recipe 2` command executes to be saved in the `cookingPapaStateList`,
and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted state of CookingPapa.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `inventory add ingredient i/Egg q/10` to add a new ingredient to the inventory.
The `inventory add` command also calls `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `cookingPapaStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, so that state of CookingPapa will not be saved into the `cookingPapaStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the ingredient to the inventory was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCookingPapa()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores CookingPapa to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial state of CookingPapa, then there will be no previous state of CookingPapa to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCookingPapa()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCookingPapa()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores CookingPapa to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `cookingPapaStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CookingPapa state, then there are no undone CookingPapa states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCookingPapa()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, `Model#undoCookingPapa()` or `Model#redoCookingPapa()`. Thus, the `cookingPapaStateList` remains unchanged.

Step 6. The user executes `cart clear`, which calls `Model#commitCookingPapa()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `cookingPapaStateList`,
all CookingPapa states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo any add commands. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state of CookingPapa.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement commands of `add` and `remove` to have the same format.
** Pros: Ease for users to easily undo or redo their own mistakes. Also gives overall lower memory usage
** Cons: Poorer user experience.

Eventually, we decided that saving the memory state of the project is still manageable, given the current scale of the project.
