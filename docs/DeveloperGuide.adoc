== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Controls the user interface of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes the commands of the App.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cookbook remove recipe 2`.

.Component interactions for `cookbook remove recipe 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CookingPapaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cookbook remove recipe 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cookbook remove recipe 2` Command
image::CookbookRemoveRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Cookbook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Cookbook`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Cookbook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add Recipe to the Cookbook
==== Implementation

The recipe addition mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookAddCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class. The format of the command is as follows: `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT_NAME]... [q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]... [t/TAG]...`

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command

. The user enters a recipe adding command using the command line input `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION
[i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]... [s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`.
.  `CookbookAddCommandParser` parsers the user input and checks if `n/NAME` and `d/DESCRIPTION` are provided. It then
parses the input into the following fields: recipe name, recipe description, ingredients, steps, and tags.

+
Note that
the ingredient names and ingredient quantities provided must be the same, or a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (names.size() != quantities.size()) {
    throw new ParseException(
        String.format(MESSAGE_DIFFERENT_NUMBER_OF_INPUTS, names.size(), quantities.size()));
}
----
{blank}

. These fields are then passed as parameters for `Recipe`, which is then passed as the parameter for
`CookbookAddCommand` and returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CookbookAddCommand#execute()` which checks if the cookbook already contains the same recipe with the same name, description, ingredient names, ingredient quantities, and tags using `Model#hasCookbookRecipe()`.
+
If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown, stating that the user is attempting to add a duplicate recipe:
+
[source,java]
----
if (model.hasCookbookRecipe(toAdd)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_RECIPE);
}
----
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCookbookRecipe` will be executed, with the recipe to be added as a parameter.
. `Model#addCookbookRecipe()` then executes `Cookbook#addRecipe()`, which adds the recipe to the cookbook, and the
`FilteredList<Recipe>` representing the recipes in the cookbook are updated with `Model#updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList()`:
+
[source,java]
----
updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES)
----
where `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES = unused -> true`.
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user is then returned to `LogicManager`, which can passed back to
`MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

.UML object diagram of Recipe
image::RecipeObjectDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation reasoning

This command is implemented this way  to allow a user to add a recipe with optional fields (ingredients, steps, tags) -
only the recipe name and recipe description are mandatory fields. This way, a user does not have input all the fields
that they may not have at the moment to create a recipe. After creating the skeleton of the recipe, the user can then
use the other `Cookbook` commands to add ingredients and steps to the recipe. However, one key point is that should
ingredient names be provided, the same number of ingredient quantities have to be provided as well.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe adding function works (full command [`cookbook add recipe
                                                                                          n/Recipe name d/Recipe
                                                                                          description i/Ingredient 1
                                                                                          q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2
                                                                                          q/20 ml s/Do step 1 s/Do
                                                                                          step 2 t/This t/Is t/A
                                                                                          t/Tag`]  omitted from diagram

==== How the feature works
Step 1: Input the command in the command box, then hit kbd:[Enter] on the keyboard. The command is as follows:
`cookbook add recipe n/Recipe name d/Recipe description i/Ingredient 1 q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2 q/20 ml s/Do step 1
 s/Do step 2 t/This t/Is t/A t/Tag`.

Step 2: Results will be parsed, and if the command is valid, a success message will be displayed to the user.

.CookbookAddCommand sample command result in Result display
image::CookbookAddRecipe2.png[]

Step 3: The newly added recipe will now appear in the recipes panel, which a brief overview, consisting of its name,
description, and tags. To view all the details of a recipe, the user can either enter `cookbook view recipe INDEX`,
where index is a valid integer, or click the view button.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect 1: How to parse optional parameters
.Design considerations for parsing optional parameters
|===
||Design A: Parse each category separately (current choice)  | Design B: Parse all the categories together
|Description
|Each category (ingredient name, ingredient quantity, step description, tag) are parsed separately and returned as `List`. If the returned `List` is empty, then it means that that field was not provided in the input, and will be set to an empty `List` in the recipe.
|Each category will be parsed together in one function in `CookbookAddCommandParser`
|Pros
a|
- Provides more flexibility for the user and does not make it mandatory to input fields that they may not necessarily.
have
- No need to deal with null values, can simply check if list is empty.
a|
- Straightforward
- No need to create and call multiple methods from other classes
|Cons
a|
- More methods have to be executed which may increase time and NPath complexity.
- Debugging and tracing becomes more confusing due to the method being defined in the lowest level of abstraction.
a|
- Have to deal with null values and include null checks (`ifPresent()` etc.)
- Method will be very long and decreases readability
|===

.Design considerations for results to show users
===== Aspect 2: Result to show user

|===
||Design A: Show a short result on the success of the command | Design B: Show all the details back to the user
|Description|Show a message to a usage which notifies them that the command was successful in adding the recipe to
the cookbook. | Shows a message similar to design choice A, and also show all the details of the added recipe.
|Pros
a|
- Short and succinct message, tells the user what they need to know
- User interface is cleaner and more intuitive, and does not overload users with unnecessary information
a|
- Easier to implement
|Cons
a|
- Requires the graphical user interface to be able to toggle and show recipes, without the need for a command,
implemented here:

image::CookbookAddRecipe3.png[]

a|
- Overloads the user with unnecessary information
- Requires result display to take up more space than required, to reduce the need for users to scroll down the result
display.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
