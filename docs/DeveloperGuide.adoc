== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Controls the user interface of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes the commands of the App.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cookbook remove recipe 2`.

.Component interactions for `cookbook remove recipe 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CookingPapaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cookbook remove recipe 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cookbook remove recipe 2` Command
image::CookbookRemoveRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Cookbook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Cookbook`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Cookbook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Cookbook` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `Inventory` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `Cart` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add Recipe to the Cookbook
==== Implementation

The recipe addition mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookAddCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class. The
format of the command is as follows: `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT_NAME]... [q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]... [t/TAG]...`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a recipe adding command using the command line input `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION
[i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]... [s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`.
.  `CookbookAddCommandParser` parsers the user input and checks if `n/NAME` and `d/DESCRIPTION` are provided. It then
parses the input into the following fields: recipe name, recipe description, ingredients, steps, and tags.

+
Note that
the ingredient names and ingredient quantities provided must be the same, or a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (names.size() != quantities.size()) {
    throw new ParseException(
        String.format(MESSAGE_DIFFERENT_NUMBER_OF_INPUTS, names.size(), quantities.size()));
}
----
{blank}

. These fields are then passed as parameters for `Recipe`, which is then passed as the parameter for
`CookbookAddCommand` and returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CookbookAddCommand#execute()` which checks if the cookbook already contains the same recipe with the same name, description, ingredient names, ingredient quantities, and tags using `Model#hasCookbookRecipe()`.
+
If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown, stating that the user is attempting to add a duplicate recipe:
+
[source,java]
----
if (model.hasCookbookRecipe(toAdd)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_RECIPE);
}
----
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCookbookRecipe` will be executed, with the recipe to be added as a parameter.
. `Model#addCookbookRecipe()` then executes `Cookbook#addRecipe()`, which adds the recipe to the cookbook, and the
`FilteredList<Recipe>` representing the recipes in the cookbook are updated with `Model#updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList()`:
+
[source,java]
----
updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES)
----
where `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES = unused -> true`.
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user is then returned to `LogicManager`, which can passed back to
`MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

.UML object diagram of Recipe
image::RecipeObjectDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation reasoning

This command is implemented this way  to allow a user to add a recipe with optional fields (ingredients, steps, tags) -
only the recipe name and recipe description are mandatory fields. This way, a user does not have input all the fields
that they may not have at the moment to create a recipe. After creating the skeleton of the recipe, the user can then
use the other `Cookbook` commands to add ingredients and steps to the recipe. However, one key point is that should
ingredient names be provided, the same number of ingredient quantities have to be provided as well.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe adding function works (full command [`cookbook add recipe
                                                                                          n/Recipe name d/Recipe
                                                                                          description i/Ingredient 1
                                                                                          q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2
                                                                                          q/20 ml s/Do step 1 s/Do
                                                                                          step 2 t/This t/Is t/A
                                                                                          t/Tag`]  omitted from diagram

==== How the feature works
Step 1: Input the command in the command box, then hit kbd:[Enter] on the keyboard. The command is as follows:
`cookbook add recipe n/Recipe name d/Recipe description i/Ingredient 1 q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2 q/20 ml s/Do step 1
 s/Do step 2 t/This t/Is t/A t/Tag`.

Step 3: The newly added recipe will now appear in the recipes panel, which a brief overview, consisting of its name,
description, and tags. To view all the details of a recipe, the user can either enter `cookbook view recipe INDEX`,
where index is a valid integer, or click the view button.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect 1: How to parse optional parameters
.Design considerations for parsing optional parameters
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
||Design A: Parse each category separately (current choice)  | Design B: Parse all the categories together
|Description
|Each category (ingredient name, ingredient quantity, step description, tag) are parsed separately and returned as `List`. If the returned `List` is empty, then it means that that field was not provided in the input, and will be set to an empty `List` in the recipe.
|Each category will be parsed together in one function in `CookbookAddCommandParser`
|Pros
a|
- Provides more flexibility for the user and does not make it mandatory to input fields that they may not necessarily
have.
- No need to deal with null values, can simply check if list is empty.
a|
- Straightforward
- No need to create and call multiple methods from other classes
|Cons
a|
- More methods have to be executed which may increase time and NPath complexity.
- Debugging and tracing becomes more confusing due to the method being defined in the lowest level of abstraction.
a|
- Have to deal with null values and include null checks (`ifPresent()` etc.)
- Method will be very long and decreases readability

=== Export ingredients in cart to PDF file
The user may use this command to export the ingredients in their cart to a PDF file, which they can then use as their
shopping list at the supermarkets.

==== Implementation
The cart exporting mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookExportCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class.
The format is as follows: `cart export`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command:

. The user enters a cart export command using the command line input `cart export`.
. `CartExportCommandParser` parses the user input and checks if the argument passed to it is an empty String, as the
command takes in no extra parameters.
+
Note that if the String is not empty, a `ParseException` will be thrown:
+
[source,java]
----
if (userInput.isEmpty()) {
    return new CartExportCommand();
} else {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, CartExportCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
----
+
This means that `cart export ingredient` will not work.
. `CartExportCommandParser` then returns a `CartExportCommand` to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartExportCommand#execute()` calls the static method of `PdfExporter`,
`PdfExporter#exportCart()`, which takes in the `ObservableList<Ingredient>` stored in `Cart`
. Step 4 is executed within a try-catch block. If a previously generated pdf (saved as `cart.pdf` by default) is
opened in another program, or there is an issue writing to the PDF file (more information can be found
https://api.itextpdf.com/iText5/5.59/com/itextpdf/text/DocumentException.html[here]), a `CommandResult` with an error
message will returned to `LogicManager`:
+
[source,java]
----
try {
    PdfExporter.exportCart(model.getCart().getIngredientList());
} catch (IOException | DocumentException e) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FILE_NOT_FOUND);
}
----
. Else, a `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user will be returned to `LogicManager`. The
`CommandResult` is then passed back to `MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI: `resultDisplay
.setFeedbackToUser(commandResult.getFeedbackToUser())`. The text displayed will notify the user on whether
their addition was successful.

==== Implementation reasoning
This command was implemented to bridge the (current, v1.4) inadequacy of Cooking Papa, which is that it is not
portable (yet). It was still not convenient _enough_ to be able to organize cart ingredients. Evenutally, users had
to go outside to the supermarket, and Cooking Papa is a desktop-only application. By allowing users to export the
ingredients in their cart to a PDF file, they can then print it out, or transfer it to their mobile devices, and
bring them along as shopping lists. Additionally, the layout and content of the generated PDF file is simple,
informational, and easy for users to extend, allowing them to add (handwritten or  annotated) remarks.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the function of exporting ingredients in the cart to a PDF file works:

a|
- Simple to implement
|Cons
a|
- More formatting code required
- May take slightly longer to export as compared to design B
a|
- Lack of design/formatting flexibility

|Pros
a|
- Easier to implement as there will be less information to parse
- Keeps the exported PDF short and sweet
- Ingredients in the inventory and recipes in the cookbook generally correlates (and are consequential of) with the
ingredients in the cart, so exporting the inventory as well as the cookbook is likely to be redundant.

a|
- Slightly more difficult to implement
- May be providing users with unnecessary information
|===

// tag::cookbooksearchinventory[]
=== Search for recipes based on ingredients in the inventory
The user may use this command to search for recipes that they can cook using the ingredients available in their inventory.
Recipes are sorted by how much the inventory fulfils their ingredient requirements.

==== Implementation
The comparison between the ingredients a recipe requires and the ingredients in the inventory is facilitated by the `RecipeInventoryIngredientsSimilarityComparator`.
It extends `Comparator<Recipe>` and stores the inventory being used for ingredient comparison.
Additionally, it implements the method `calculateSimilarity()`, which accepts a `Recipe` and a `ReadOnlyInventory` as parameters,
and returns a double value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that represents the proportion of the recipe's ingredient requirements that are fulfilled.

The `calculateSimilarity()` method first calculates the proportion of ingredient quantity fulfilled by the inventory for each ingredient that the recipe requires.
For example, if one of the ingredients required by a recipe is `4 eggs` and the inventory contains `2 eggs`, the proportion fulfilled for this particular ingredient is `0.5`.
This is done for all the ingredients in the recipe. If the units of an ingredient in the recipe does not match that of the same ingredient in the inventory,
the proportion will be set at `0.5` by default. An example is when the recipe requires `1 cup flour` and the inventory contains `200 g flour`.

When the proportion fulfilled has been calculated for each ingredient, the values for each ingredient are summed up and divided by the number of ingredients to obtain the average.
In the case where the recipe does not have any ingredients added to it yet, the `calculateSimilarity()` method will return `0`, indicating no similarity to the inventory ingredients.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how objects interact when a user executes the command,
with more focus on how the command is parsed in the `Logic`component:

image::CookbookSearchByInventorySequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect 1: Weighting of each ingredient
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Every ingredient is weighted equally | Design B: More important ingredients are given a larger weigting

| Description
| The similarity of a recipe's ingredients to an inventory's ingredients is calculated by taking the mean of the proportions calculated for each ingredient,
with equal weighting given to all ingredients.
|The similarity of a recipe's ingredients to an inventory's ingredients is calculated by taking the weighted mean of the proportions calculated for each ingredient,
with larger weightings given to more important ingredients ingredients.

| Pros
| Gives a good rough estimate of the proportion of ingredient requirements fulfilled for a recipe, and straightforward to implement.
| May give a better gauge of the proportion of ingredient requirements fulfilled for a recipe, by accounting for the importance of the ingredient.
For example, beef would be an important ingredient for a steak recipe, but garnishes might be considered less important as they can be substituted more easily.

| Cons
| Does not account for the importance of the ingredient in the recipe
| Difficult to judge the importance of the ingredient, and complicated to implement categorisation of the types ingredients and their relative importance.
|===

Design A was chosen as it provided a fair estimate of the similarity between the recipe and inventory ingredients, with a simple implementation.
The cons for Design B were deemed to outweigh the pros, especially since the importance of an ingredient in a recipe could be rather subjective.

===== Aspect 2: Handling ingredients with different units
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Use a default similarity value of `0.5` | Design B: Convert the units

| Description
| The similarity value of an ingredient with different units in the recipe and the inventory is treated as `0.5`.
| The similarity value of an ingredient with different units in the recipe and the inventory is calculated by converting the units,
such that the proportion of the recipe ingredient in the inventory can be determined.

| Pros
| Simple to implement.
| Able to calculate the proportion of the recipe ingredient fulfilled by the inventory, even when dealing with different units.

| Cons
| Unable to calculate the proportion of the recipe ingredient fulfilled by the inventory when dealing with different units, and can only give a fixed default value of `0.5`.
| More complicated to implement as it requires CookingPapa to recognise the units in both the recipe and inventory and be able to convert between them.
Some units such as `cup` may also not have a standard conversion factor.
|===

Design A was chosen due to time constraints, as handling the conversion between different units would take time away from developing other parts of the application.
Given more time, Design B will be implemented to handle conversion for standard units, such as between `g` and `kg`, but Design A would still have to be used for units with non-standard conversion factors.
// end::cookbooksearchinventory[]

=== Adding ingredients to inventory and cart
The inventory and cart acts as storage for `Ingredient` classes. They are facilitated by `InventoryCommand` and `CartCommand`
respectively, which extends the `Command` abstract class. Since `CartAddCommand` and `InventoryAddCommand` both serve the
same purpose in different contexts of `Cart` and `Inventory` respectively, they will be mentioned together in tandem. +
The format of the commands are as follows:

* For cart: `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
* For inventory: `inventory add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

==== Implementation

Below is a step-by-step sequence of what happens when the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` is added.

. The user adds a ingredient to the cart by entering the command `cart  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` in the command line input.
. `CartAddCommandParser` parsers the input to check and verify that the input provided for `i/INGREDIENT_NAME` amd `q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
are correct. Otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown.
. The fields are then passed to `CartAddIngredientCommand` as an `Ingredient` object and is returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartAddIngredientCommand#execute()` and checks if the `Ingredient` object given has the same `INGREDIENT_NAME` and
`INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` unit. If that `Ingredient` exists, it will simply add on to the quantity of that ingredient. Otherwise,
a new instance of that `Ingredient` will be added to the Cart.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCartIngredient` will be executed, with the given `Ingredient` as the parameter
. `Model#addCartIngredient` then executes, adding the `Ingredient` to the local cart storage and updates with
`Model#updateFilteredCartIngredientList()`.
. A `CommandResult` with the successful text message is returned to `LogicManager` and will be displayed to the user via the GUI to feedback to the
user that the `Ingredient` has been successfully added.

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory` with the command `inventory  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

==== Implementation reasoning
This command was implemented to allow the user know to add an ingredient to the cart or inventory respectively.
An ingredient only has two main components - its name and quantity. We allow the user to use their own measurement up to their own
preferences and do not force any fixed unit of measurement. Although similar, `Cart` and `Ingredients` differ in certain functions
from a user's point of view. For a user to immediately sort where they wish to sort the ingredient they are adding, `Cart` and
`Inventory` is the first parameter they would use for the command.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the function of adding ingredients to cart work (full command omitted for brevity):

.Sequence diagram for CartAddIngredientCommand
image::CartAddIngredientSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== How the feature works

Step 1: The below diagram shows an initially empty cart

image::CartAddCommand1.png[]

Step 2: Input the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`. An example command is as follows: `cart add ingredient i/Eggs q/10`.

image::CartAddCommand2.png[]

Step 3: Hit kbd:[Enter]. The cart should be updated as follows:

image::CartAddCommand3.png[]

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory`

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: The need for many parsers for this command

.Design considerations for the need for many parsers for this command
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Create parsers for every individual action | Design B: Create parsers for each specific action

|Description
|The command will go through the parsers in the following order: `CookingPapaParser` -> `CartCommandParser` -> `CartAddCommandParser`
-> `CartAddIngredientParser` before finally returning `CartAddIngredientCommand`. We eventually went with this as we wanted the add
functionality to be expanded, namely to be able to add all the ingredients of cookbook recipes into the cart.
| `CartAddCommand` will not be created facilitate `CartAddIngredientCommand` and `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand`.


|Pros
|More organised and can do more with `cart add` as the prefix.
|Many parser classes to make and keep track of.

|Cons
|The classes can be more specific and atomic in their actions.
|Might lead to disorganisation during troubleshooting with so many classes to keep track.
|===

=== Moving ingredients from cart to inventory
The user may use this command after their shopping trip. With this one command, all ingredients will be shifted from the cart to the inventory.

==== Implementation
This command is facilitated by `CartMoveCommand`, which extends the `Command` class. The format of the command is as follows:
`cart move`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when the user executes this command.

. The user enters the command `cart move` in to the command line input.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then ensures that the user does not enter any other commands after `cart clear`.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then returns a `CartMoveCommand` and returns it to `LogicManager`
. `LogicManager` calls `CartMoveCommand#execute()`. If there are other commands after `cart clear`, a `CommandException`
will be thrown.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will be executed.
. `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will move every ingredient from the `cart` and add it into the `inventory`
. A `CommandResult` with the success message text will be returned to `LogicManager`, which will then be passed to `MainWindow`
and will then feedback to the user.

==== Implementation reasoning
This command is implemented to ease the process of having the user adding every single ingredient to their inventory after they have bought ingredients from their cart
and eventually deleting the cart after that tedious process. These gives a convenience to users that frequently use our application and we forsee
that such an action will be used very often by these users. As this command only performs an atomic action, no extra
arguments are needed to further supplement the use of this command.

==== Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how this function works (full command omitted for brevity):

.Sequence Diagram for CartMoveCommand
image::CartMoveSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== How this feature works
Step 1: This feature is intended when you have ingredients in the cart. As an example, the diagram below shows an
empty inventory, along with a cart with an ingredient.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Allowing users to move some or all ingredients from cart to inventory

.Design considerations for allowing users to move some or all ingredients from cart to inventory
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Move all ingredients | Design B: Allow users to move individually or exclude some ingredients when moving

|Description
|There was a consideration to allow the user to move the ingredients by individual ingredients. Eventually the options was
not given as we know that typical users will want to move all the ingredients except for individual ingredients.
| The use cases of such an action happening is very little and the user can simply manually remove the few
ingredients they do not wish to add to the inventory after using the `cart move` command. The user can also manually
add back the ingredients to the cart after it is cleared if they wish to.

|Pros
|Straightforward to implement
|Lesser implementations, more time to focus on other parts of the project

|Cons
|Lesser functionality to users that really want to only move certain ingredients
|Poorer user experience for users that do not want to move all ingredients from the cart to inventory on a regular basis,

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on, and are in no way exhaustive.

Below are some test inputs for manual testing, please note that these test inputs are *only* valid for the sample
cookbook, cart, and inventory data, i.e. the data that is present when Cooking Papa is opened for the first time. If
the data has been modified prior to using these commands, please delete the `.json` files in `/data` (`cookbook
                                                                                                       .json`, `inventory.json`, `cart.json`).

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample cookbook, inventory, and cart.

=== Adding a recipe to the cookbook

Please note that these cases are to be tested individually, i.e. should test case
a be executed, executing test case e will not be valid as there is already an existing recipe with the recipe name
"Name". In such cases, please remove the existing recipe in the cookbook using `cookbook remove recipe INDEX`.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook using the `cookbook list` command, and *using the sample cookbook*.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1 t/Tag` +
   Expected: a new recipe is added to the cookbook, and displayed as the index 3 (one-based index) in the cookbook
panel.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1 t/Tag` (a duplicate recipe) +
   Expected: no recipe will be added, and an error message indicating that there is already an existing recipe with
the same name in the cookbook will
be displayed.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1 s/Step 1 t/Tag` (a recipe with
duplicated
steps) +
   Expected: no recipe will be added, and an error message indicating that there is a duplicate step  in the command
will
be displayed.
.. Test case: `cookbook add recipe n/Name d/Description i/Ingredient q/1 i/Ingredient q/1 s/Step 1t/Tag` (a recipe with
duplicated
ingredients) +
   Expected: a new recipe is added to the cookbook, with the duplicate ingredients being added to one another. The
new recipe will be displayed as the index 3 (one-based index) in the cookbook panel.

=== Removing a recipe from the cookbook
Please note that these test cases are to be tested individually, i.e. should test case a be executed, executing test
case a again will remove a different recipe from the cookbook. In this case, after executing test case a once, to
execute it again, please add back the removed recipe using `cookbook add recipe ...` or by deleting the `.json` files.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook using the `cookbook list` command, and *using the sample
cookbook*.
.. Test case: `cookbook remove recipe 1` +
    Expected: a recipe (Aglio Olio) will be removed from the cookbook.
.. Test case: `cookbook remove recipe 0` and `cookbook remove recipe 5` +
    Expected: since the indices in the recipe panel are one-based, i.e. starting from 1, the former command is
out-of-bounds; the latter command is out-of-bounds because there are only 4 recipes in the cookbook. Both commands
will show an error message reflecting the invalid recipe indices provided.

=== Searching for recipes by tags
Please note for this search command, with more tags being included, the number of results returned will be greater, i
.e. if
there are three tags included, the recipes returned do not have to be tagged with all three tags.

.. Prerequisites: List all recipes in the cookbook using the `cookbook list` command, and *using the sample cookbook*.
.. Test case: `cookbook search tag t/Simple` +
    Expected: the recipe panel will be updated to show only two recipes, both which are tagged with "Simple".
.. Test case: 'cookbook search tag t/Simple t/Celebrity'
    Expected: the recipe panel will be updated to show only three recipes, of these three recipes, they are either
tagged with "Simple" or "Celebrity".

=== Exporting the cart to a PDF file
Please note that for the export command, the result is based on the sample cart.
a. Prerequisite: have the sample cart data in `cart.json`, if the file has been modified, please exit Cooking Papa,
and delete it in `/data`, and run Cooking Papa again.

.. Test case: `cart export`
    Expected: a PDF file will be created in the same folder as Cooking Papa, and the content should look like:
+
.Content of cart.pdf created from sample cart data
image::CookbookExportExample2.png[]

.. Test case: `cart export`, with a previously created `cart.pdf` open in a program
    Expected: an error will be thrown, as `PdfExporter` is unable to modify a file that is currently open in another
program. Closing the file and executing the command will return the same result (assuming the cart data is the same
as the sample cart data)
as test case a.

== Effort
[cols="25%,65%,10%"]
|===
|Achievements/ challenges|Effort required|Difficulty level (out of `\***` )
|Greater number of entities than AB3|As AB3 only had one overarching entity (`Person`), it was a challenge to extract
the implementation for `Person` and apply it to three overarching entities (`Cart`, `Cookbook`, `Inventory`). Much
time was spent refactoring to our needs, but was not too tough given the great documentation and clarity in AB3's
code.|`**`
|Development of the GUI | As the team had not much experience with regards to CSS and JavaFX, it took awhile to get
rolling and adapt the aesthetics to Cooking Papa's needs. Moreover, one challenge faced was ensuring that the GUI ran
as expected on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Additionally, the use of SceneBuilder was encouraged, however, it led to many unintended changes and extra variables
which made troubleshooting a lot more complex (especially to a novice).
|`**`
|Integrating `cookbook view command` with a button on the GUI|We wanted to make the command more of a toggle instead
of something users *had* to type, as it was not intuitive. While implementing the button was rather trivial, one
requirement of the app was that it had to be testable via the command line. Connecting the command from the command
line (`Logic`) to the `UI` was a big challenge, especially while trying to maintain the abstraction between the
two.

In hindsight, perhaps greater experience with GUIs would have made this process easier, but our team were
all novices in that aspect, and being able to pull this off, especially when we could have simply left it as the
status quo, is a huge achievement.|`\***`
