== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Controls the user interface of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes the commands of the App.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cookbook remove recipe 2`.

.Component interactions for `cookbook remove recipe 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CookingPapaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cookbook remove recipe 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cookbook remove recipe 2` Command
image::CookbookRemoveRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Cookbook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Cookbook`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Cookbook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add Recipe to the Cookbook
==== Implementation

The recipe addition mechanism is facilitated by `CookbookAddCommand`, which extends the `Command` abstract class. The format of the command is as follows: `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT_NAME]... [q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY]... [t/TAG]...`

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters this command

. The user enters a recipe adding command using the command line input `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]... [x/STEP_INDEX]... [s/STEP_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`.
. `CookbookAddCommandParser` parsers the user input and checks if `n/NAME` and `d/DESCRIPTION` are provided. It then parses the input into the following fields: recipe name, recipe description, ingredients, and tags. Note that the ingredient names and ingredient quantities provided must be the same, or a `ParseException` will be thrown, likewise for step indices and step descriptions.
. These fields are then passed as parameters for `Recipe`, which is then passed as the parameter for `CookbookAddCommand` and returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CookbookAddCommand#execute()` which checks if the cookbook already contains the same recipe with the same name, description, ingredient names, ingredient quantities, and tags using `Model#hasCookbookRecipe()`. If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown, stating that the user is attempting to add a duplicate recipe.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCookbookRecipe` will be executed, with the recipe to be added as a parameter.
. `Model#addCookbookRecipe()` then executes `Cookbook#addRecipe()`, which adds the recipe to the cookbook, and the `FilteredList<Recipe>` representing the recipes in the cookbook are updated with `Model#updateFilteredCookbookRecipeList()`
. A `CommandResult` with the text to display to the user is then returned to `LogicManager`, which can passed back to `MainWindow`, which displays it to the user on the CLI and GUI.

==== Implementation reasoning

This command is implemented this way  to allow a user to add a recipe with optional fields (ingredients, tags) - only the recipe name and recipe description are mandatory fields. This way, a user does not have input all the fields that they may not have at the moment to create a recipe. After creating the skeleton of the recipe, the user can then use the other `Cookbook` methods to add ingredients and steps to the recipe. However, one key point is that should ingredient names be provided, the same number of ingredient quantities have to be provided as well, vice versa, likewise for step indices and step descriptions.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe adding function works (full command omitted for brevity):

image::CookbookAddRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== How the feature works
Step 1: Input the command in the command box, then hit kbd:[Enter] on the keyboard. The command is as follows:
`cookbook add recipe n/Recipe name d/Recipe description i/Ingredient 1 q/1 piece i/Ingredient 2 q/20 ml x/1 s/Do step 1 x/2 s/Do step 2 t/This t/Is t/A t/Tag`.

image::CookbookAddRecipe1.png[]

Step 2: Results will be parsed and displayed back to the user.

image::CookbookAddRecipe2.png[]

Step 3: The newly added recipe will now appear in the recipes panel, which a brief overview, consisting of its name, description, and tags.

image::CookbookAddRecipe3.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How to parse optional fields
- Alternative 1 (current choice): Parse each category separately
* Each category (ingredient name, ingredient quantity, step index, step description, tag) are parsed separately and returned as `List`. If the returned `List` is empty, then it means that that field was not provided in the input, and will be set to an empty `List` in the recipe.
* Pros: Provides more flexibility for the user, no need to deal with null values
* Cons: More methods have to be executed which may increase time complexity

- Alternative 2: Parse all the categories together
* Each category will be parse together in one function
* Pros: Straightforward, no need to call multiple functions from other classes
* Cons: Have to deal with null values and include null checks (`ifPresent()` etc.), method will be very long and decreases readability

===== Aspect: String formatting for CommandResult
- Alternative 1 (current choice): Separate each field with newlines
* Pros: vastly improves readability
* Cons: smaller font size to improve fit in `ResultDisplay`

- Alternatve 2: Combine all the fields in one line
* Pros: bigger font size due to the lack of newlines
* Cons: difficult to read, difficult for user to extract desired information from the text in `ResultDisplay`

=== Adding ingredients to inventory and cart
The inventory and cart acts as storage for `Ingredient` classes. They are facilitated by `InventoryCommand` and `CartCommand`
respectively, which extends the `Command` abstract class. Since `CartAddCommand` and `InventoryAddCommand` both serve the
same purpose in different contexts of `Cart` and `Inventory` respectively, they will be mentioned together in tandem. +
The format of the commands are as follows:

* For cart: `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
* For inventory: `inventory add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

==== Implementation

Below is a step-by-step sequence of what happens when the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` is added.

. The user adds a ingredient to the cart by entering the command `cart  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` in the command line input.
. `CartAddCommandParser` parsers the input to check and verify that the input provided for `i/INGREDIENT_NAME` amd `q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
are correct. Otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown.
. The fields are then passed to `CartAddIngredientCommand` as an `Ingredient` object and is returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartAddIngredientCommand#execute()` and checks if the `Ingredient` object given has the same `INGREDIENT_NAME` and
`INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` unit. If that `Ingredient` exists, it will simply add on to the quantity of that ingredient. Otherwise,
a new instance of that `Ingredient` will be added to the Cart.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCartIngredient` will be executed, with the given `Ingredient` as the parameter
. `Model#addCartIngredient` then executes, adding the `Ingredient` to the local cart storage and updates with `Model#updateFilteredCartIngredientList()`.
. A `CommandResult` with the successful text message is returned to `LogicManager` and will be displayed to the user via the GUI to feedback to the
user that the `Ingredient` has been successfully added.

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory` with the command `inventory  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

==== Implementation reasoning
This command was implemented to allow the user know to add an ingredient to the cart or inventory respectively.
An ingredient only has two main components - its' name and quantity. We allow the user to use their own measurement up to their own
preferences and do not force any fixed unit of measurement. Although similar, `Cart` and `Ingredients` differ in certain functions
from a user's point of view. For a user to immediately sort where they wish to sort the ingredient they are adding, `Cart` and
`Inventory` is the first parameter they would use for the command.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the function of adding ingredients to cart work (full command omitted for brevity):

image::CartAddIngredientSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== How the feature works

Step 1: The below diagram shows an initially empty cart

image::CartAddCommand1.png[]

Step 2: Input the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`. An example command is as follows: `cart add ingredient i/Eggs q/10`.

image::CartAddCommand2.png[]

Step 3: Hit kbd:[Enter]. The cart should be updated as follows:

image::CartAddCommand3.png[]

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory`

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: The need for many parsers just for one command

* Alternative 1 (Current choice): Create parsers for every individual action
** The command will go through the parsers in the following order: CookingPapaParser -> CartCommandParser -> CartAddCommandParser
-> CartAddIngredientParser before finally returning CartAddIngredientCommand. We eventually went with this as we wanted the add
functionality to be expanded, namely to be able to add all the ingredients of cookbook recipes into the cart.
** Pros: More organised and can do more with `cart add` as the prefix.
** Cons: Many parser classes to make and keep track of.

* Alternative 2: Create parsers for each specific action
** This would mean that `CartAddCommand` will not be created facilitate `CartAddIngredientCommand` and `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand`.
** Pros: The classes can be more specific and atomic in their actions.
** Cons: Might lead to disorganisation during troubleshooting with so many classes to keep track.

=== Moving ingredients from cart to inventory

=== Search recipes from the current cookbook from the current inventory.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism will be facilitated by `VersionedCookingPapa`.
It extends `CookingPapa` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `cookingPapaStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCookingPapa#commit()` -- Saves the current state of CookingPapa in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous state of CookingPapa from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone state of CookingPapa from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, `Model#undoCookingPapa()` and `Model#redoCookingPapa()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCookingPapa` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CookingPapa state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `cookbook remove recipe 2` command to delete the 2nd recipe in the cookbook of CookingPapa.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `cookbook remove recipe 2` command executes to be saved in the `cookingPapaStateList`,
and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted state of CookingPapa.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `inventory add ingredient i/Egg q/10` to add a new ingredient to the inventory.
The `inventory add` command also calls `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `cookingPapaStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, so that state of CookingPapa will not be saved into the `cookingPapaStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the ingredient to the inventory was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCookingPapa()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores CookingPapa to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial state of CookingPapa, then there will be no previous state of CookingPapa to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCookingPapa()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCookingPapa()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores CookingPapa to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `cookingPapaStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CookingPapa state, then there are no undone CookingPapa states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCookingPapa()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCookingPapa()`, `Model#undoCookingPapa()` or `Model#redoCookingPapa()`. Thus, the `cookingPapaStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `cart clear`, which calls `Model#commitCookingPapa()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `cookingPapaStateList`,
all CookingPapa states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo any add commands. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state of CookingPapa.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement commands of `add` and `remove` to have the same format.
** Pros: Ease for users to easily undo or redo their own mistakes. Lower memory usage
** Cons: Poor user experience.

Eventually, we decided that saving the memory state of the project is still manageable, given the current scale of the project.
